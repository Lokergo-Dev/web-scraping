# Web Scraping

First, we use BeautifulSoup and Selenium to extract essential information such as job titles, required skills, educational levels, salaries, links, and so on from various job vacancy websites such as Kitalulus.com, Glints.id, and so on. The algorithm is then stored on Google Cloud for daily updates via Google Scheduler. The data scraped will be used by the machine learning algorithm and displayed on the platform.
